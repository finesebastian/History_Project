                <span style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: underline;">Abstraction</span>
                - Provides a separation from the user and the software, whereas in the calculator program the user knows to input a tuple and specify the operation to perform
                but does not know the specific methodology in which the calculator is performing the operations and storage.
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: underline;">Arguments (Parameters)</span>
                - An argument is a set of parameters to be passed for creating an instance of class, or object, or data to perform a function.
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: underline;">Class</span>
                - A class contains methods and functions which create objects and their behaviors, such as the calculations class which stores the history of the calculators \
                calculations.
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: underline;">Class Method</span>
                - Class methods refer to method calls which are performed on classes rather than an identifier (class instances). For the calculator program this can be viewed within
                the calculation.py file.
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: underline;">Constructor</span>
                - A constructor is used to create an object. Constructors can take arguments to set initial values (such as Addition, Subtraction, Division, and Multiplication requiring
                a tuple).
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: underline;">Design Patterns</span>
                - A type of Design Pattern (Behavior) used within the calculator program is the Command Pattern. Further reading of the various design pattern types can be viewed
                <a href="https://www.oodesign.com/"> here.</a>
                <span style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: underline;">Encapsulation</span>
                - Encapsulation is utilized to group data and methods into one point of reference. The calculator program demonstrated encapsulation with the utilization of
                class (such as calculations) which contain a set of methods that can store, recall, and evaluate other aspects of the initial tuple and subsequent tuples
                passed to it.
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: underline;">Facade</span>
                - A facade is a type of pattern which masks more complex software functions. A clearer example of a facade is the calculator class, which references to more complex structural
                code to perform the method calculation and store to history.
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: underline;"> Factory</span>
                    - For the calculator program, a <span style="font-weight: bold;text-decoration: underline"> factory method </span> is utilized in the calculation.py file within the calculations directory as
                    the <span style="font-weight: bold">"create"</span> method that allows for an calculation object (Addition, Subtraction, Division, Multiplication) to be made with a tuple of values.
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: underline;">Fixture</span>
                - A fixture is utilized, within the calculator program, as a way to establish sample data that is provided to each test without having to copy repetitive constructions of
                the calculator Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication/Division objects.
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: underline;">Instantiation</span>
                - In the context of the calculator one instance of instantiation is related to the calculations class where an object is created with a defined name.
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: underline;">Method</span>
                - A method is a function/action that is performed on a variable with arguments (parameters) that can return output or change the state of the variable.
                For the calculator program, there are methods which call methods from imported classes (add_number, subtract_number, ...)
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: underline;">Namespace</span>
                - A namespace is a defined region of visibility for a set of identifiers - such as the calculator being able to call Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division without
                having to specify that it is within the calculator class.
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: underline;">Object</span>
                - An object is an instance of a class, such as an instance of the calculations class, or set of functions and methods referred to by a singular identifier.
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: underline;">Property</span>
                - Properties are the characteristics of an object, such that a calculator object can add_number, divide_number, subtract_number, or multiple_number. The object
                can also return the last result. The properties of the calculator class are the tuple(s) of numbers and the result from the calculation performed on them.
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: underline;">Static</span>
                - Statics refer to a method (for the calculator program) or variable which can be referenced across any instances of the class the method is contained within.
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: underline;">Type Cast</span>
                - A type cast converts a given data type into another. For instance a list (mutable) can be cast to a tuple (immutable).
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: underline;">Type Hint</span>
                - A type hint is utilized by a function that accepts arguments to only allow specifically declared data types - such as the type hint for tuples.
                <br>
                <span style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: underline;">Unit Test</span>
                - A unit test is often implemented to evaluate methods, or class for an interface, of a class. Unit tests were used within the calculator to demonstrate
                the proper mathematical function, storage, and recall of given sets of tuples.

        <p>
            Pylint is a powerful tool for reviewing the functionality, industry-conformity, and quality of written code. To install Pylint for <span style="font-weight: bold">Windows </span>
            you must have pip installed within your environment. Running the command "pip install pylint" will download the packages to be able to use Pylint. If you are utilizing PyCharm, a
            simple method to install Pylint follows the Preferences (File > Settings) > Plugins > Browse Repos and selecting Pylint for installation. If you have a requirements.txt file
            there is a further ability to evaluate your tests and coverage by adding pytest-cov (along with pytest and pytest-pylint) and running the container.
